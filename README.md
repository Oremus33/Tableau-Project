Part 1.
According to the dashboard named “compare region/ship mode,” the two biggest profit centers are shipping mode + product ID though only slightly. Shipping mode + product ID are also the two biggest loss-makers as well, making it not worth it in the end. 

According to the sheet “Product/ Losses,” the superstore should stop selling the following items Bush Advantage Collection Racetrack Conference Table, Cubify Cube 3D printer Double Head Print, and  GBC Docubind P400 Electric Binding System because they incur significant losses. 

According to the sheet, “product focus/ cease” the superstore should focus on Accessories, Copiers, and Phones and should stop selling Bookcases, Supplies, and Tables

Part 2.

According to the sheet named “Ads,” the best combination of states and month of the year to advertise is Missouri - October - Indiana - October - Vermont - November.

According to sheet “ad months/states” I would be willing to pay Missouri - October - 48.61, Indiana - October - 64.31, and Vermont - November - 59.6 respectively. 
Part 3.

According to the sheet, “Product return rate the products with the highest return rates are Advantus Push Pins, Global Leather Task Chair, Global Troy Executive Leather Tilter, KI Adjustable Height Table

According to the sheet “customer return,” the customers with the highest return rates are Seth Vernon, Ted Butterfield, and William Brown. 

On the dashboard “profit/return” we see the profits and returns against the dimension “region.” According to this visual the superstore should continue to do business based on this dimension “region” because they have a good amount of profit and returns in all but one region, “Central”
